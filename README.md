# Spanish People Residing Abroad in 2024

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing the Spanish population residing abroad in the year 2024. The analysis involves several steps, including data retrieval, preprocessing, visualization, and mapping.

### Data Retrieval and Preprocessing

The population data for Spanish citizens living abroad in 2024 was obtained from an Excel spreadsheet. The Excel file was extracted from the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica (INE), specifically the dataset titled "Población Española residente en el extranjero por país de residencia, sexo y año de referencia." After loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame, preprocessing steps were carried out to clean and prepare the data for analysis.


### Mapping with Folium

Folium, a Python library, was utilized for geographical mapping. GeoJSON data for all countries was fetched using the Requests library. The data was then visualized on an interactive map using Folium. Country names were translated to English using the Googletrans library, and fuzzy matching was employed for matching country names.

### Visualization with Matplotlib

Matplotlib was used for data visualization, particularly for creating a horizontal bar plot. The top 5 countries with the highest Spanish population were identified and visualized using Matplotlib. Additionally, the bar plot was customized with country names on the y-axis to provide clear identification.

### Technologies Used

- **Folium**: For mapping countries and adding GeoJSON layers.
- **Branca**: For creating custom colormap for the map.
- **Requests**: For fetching GeoJSON data.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations and array manipulation.
- **Geopy**: For geocoding and obtaining country coordinates.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and loading Excel data.
- **PyCountry**: For obtaining country information and ISO codes.
- **Googletrans**: For translating country names to English.
- **Fuzzywuzzy**: For fuzzy matching English country names.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, specifically creating horizontal bar plots.

## File Structure

The repository consists of the following files and directories:

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, methodologies, and technologies used.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **spanish.py**: Contains the Python code for analyzing the Spanish population residing abroad in 2024. This file includes functions for data retrieval, preprocessing, visualization, and mapping.
- **sp2024.xlsx**: Excel spreadsheet containing the population data for Spanish citizens living abroad in 2024. This data was extracted from the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica (INE).
- **world_2024.html**: HTML file generated by the Python code using Folium, displaying an interactive map of the Spanish population distribution across different countries.
- **top_5_countries.png**: PNG image file generated by the Python code using Matplotlib, displaying a horizontal bar plot of the top 5 countries with the highest Spanish population.

## How to Use
